<h1>Helps Release Notes</h1>
<h2>v1.1.4</h2>
<p>Resolved #5 (parameter info must be validated).</p>
<h2>v1.1.3</h2>
<p>Resolved #4 (<em>wildcard</em> in parameter info).</p>
<h2>v1.1.2</h2>
<p>Added support for default parameter values. Example:</p>
<pre><code># just description
Param1 = 'Description 1.'

# with default value
Param2 = @{
    default = 'Default value 2.'
    description = 'Description 2.'
}
</code></pre>

<h2>v1.1.1</h2>
<p><strong>Ignore empty inputs/outputs</strong></p>
<p><code>Convert-Helps</code> does not write warnings on missing inputs and outputs. Also, it
does not generate &quot;-&quot; if they are empty, this results in extra empty lines, not
always wanted. Some developers may prefer to have these sections with no text.</p>
<h2>v1.1.0</h2>
<p><strong>Ignore dynamic parameters</strong></p>
<p>Dynamic parameters, if any, are ignored as if they do not exist. They may be
documented in the description, for example in a manually added text section
DYNAMIC PARAMETERS.</p>
<p>Otherwise, depending on a command, there are too many issues. Some commands do
not even know what names their dynamic parameters may have. They may depend on
a yet unknown context and the current context on building the help may produce
some unwanted dynamic parameters.</p>
<p>Excluded the directory <em>Demo</em> from the package, as not really relevant. It can
be found at the project site and downloaded with other source files, if needed.</p>
<h2>v1.0.9</h2>
<p><strong>PS v4.0 upgrade</strong></p>
<p>Adjusted for the new common parameter <em>PipelineVariable</em>.</p>
<h2>v1.0.8</h2>
<p>Fixed <a href="https://github.com/nightroman/Helps/issues/2">#2</a>, added a test.</p>
<h2>v1.0.7</h2>
<p>Improved various errors thrown by the engine. Added tests covering some errors.</p>
<p>Replaced the word &quot;None&quot; for empty <code>inputs</code> and <code>outputs</code> (<code>@()</code>) with the
culture neutral symbol &quot;-&quot;. If this is not suitable then do not use <code>@()</code>.</p>
<p>Mixed help (cmdlets and functions together) is allowed. But it still should be
avoided because there are issues in PowerShell v2.</p>
<p>Renamed own help file <em>Helps.ps1-Help.xml</em> files to <em>Helps-Help.xml</em>.</p>
<h2>v1.0.6</h2>
<p>Adapted for PowerShell V3 CTP2.</p>
<h2>v1.0.4, v1.0.5</h2>
<p><strong>Breaking change</strong></p>
<p>The module <em>Helps</em> was converted into the script <em>Helps.ps1</em>. It looks like the
script module had issues. In particular, <em>Get-Command</em> called from the module
could not see some definitely available commands. In contrast, the script
<em>Helps.ps1</em> works fine in all known so far use cases.</p>
<p>This change is breaking but updates are easy. The script <em>Helps.ps1</em> should be
located in the path and dot-sourced. That is,</p>
<pre><code>Import-Module Helps
</code></pre>

<p>in old code should be replaced with</p>
<pre><code>. Helps.ps1
</code></pre>

<p>See <em>README</em> for more about installation and usage options.</p>
<p><strong>Other changes</strong></p>
<p><code>New-Helps</code> generates <code>sets</code> only if there are 2+ parameter sets. It does not
output empty <code>parameters</code> entry. <code>links</code> item is generated as one line <code>@{...}</code>.</p>
<p><code>Convert-Helps</code> converts tabs into 4 spaces (that is what presumably PowerShell
formatting does anyway).</p>
<h2>v1.0.3</h2>
<p>Command parameters: yet missing pipeline input information is now generated.</p>
<h2>v1.0.2</h2>
<p>Added <em>README.htm</em> and <em>Release Notes.htm</em>.</p>
<p><code>Test-Helps</code> uses private local variables.</p>
<h2>v1.0.1</h2>
<p>Converted localized files to UTF8.</p>
<h2>v1.0.0</h2>
<p>New exported function <code>New-Helps</code> creates help and optional localized data
templates for commands and providers. Removed obsolete <em>Template-Help.ps1</em>.</p>
<h2>v1.0.0.rc4</h2>
<p>New exported function <code>Merge-Helps</code>. It is used in order to merge the help table
of a base cmdlet with help tables of derived cmdlets. <code>parameters</code> are merged;
child <code>inputs</code>, <code>outputs</code>, <code>examples</code>, <code>links</code> are appended to the base; other
child values override base. In other words, help of derived cmdlets is derived
from base cmdlet help by Merge-Helps.</p>
<p><em>Helps-Help.ps1</em> (help script of this module) uses this approach.</p>
<h2>v1.0.0.rc1 - v1.0.0.rc3</h2>
<p>Overall stabilization.</p>
<h2>v1.0.0.rc0</h2>
<p>The first release candidate.</p>
